basic structure:

command -arg1 -arg2 etc...

  * [ERR] an argument can't contain whitespaces or qoutation marks

redirection:

  * [ERR] a command block may have a single output or input character 

> output redirection

>> append output redirection

< input redirection

  * [ERR] an input line cannot end with the following chars: < , > , >>
  * [ERR] a command block does output redirection and ends with a pipe

for simplicity's sake:

  * [ERR] a < file1.txt > file2.txt: make file1.txt the input of a. write the output of a to file2.txt

  * [ERR] a > file1.txt < file2.txt: make file2.txt the input of a. write the output of a to file1.txt 

| pipe

  * [ERR] a pipe followed by no command

a | b | c: the output of a is the input of b. the output of b is the input of c. a, b, c run concurrently. the pipe transfers the data in "real time"
													   (i.e not sequentially from a to b to c).

background:

& run process in bg

a && b: run b after a exited successfully

a & b & c &: concurrently run a, b, c in the background. stream the output of a, b, c to the parent shell.

delimiters:

  | , & , && 
  
  * these delimiters seperate command blocks. i.e cmd1 -arg1 -arg2 (delimiter) cmd2 -arg1 -arg2 (delimiter) cmd3 -arg1 -arg2 etc..
  * [ERR] consecutive delimiters are not allowed (with or without whitespaces)
